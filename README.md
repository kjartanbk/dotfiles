# Various config files

To install, run `config.sh` in the directory `~/dotfiles`.

For the vim powerline to work, run 
`# apt-get install python-pip`
and
`$ pip install --user git+git://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline`

Config files for the *i3* window manager are included. 
Some of the *i3blocks* scripts are provided in the original installation but the ones in the **.i3scripts/config** folder are written by me.
The following packages are used in the *i3* config:
 
 * **feh**, can be found in apt.
 * **playerctl**, can be found [here][1] 

The *i3* setup also uses the *Font-Awesome* and *Yosemite San Fransisco Font* fonts, located in the **fonts** folder.
The github repository for *Font-Awesome* can be found [here][2]
The github repository for *Yosemite San Fransisco Font* can be found [here][3]
